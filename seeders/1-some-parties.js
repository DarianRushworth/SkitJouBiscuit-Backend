          Mushroom Valley is more than just a party, it is a community, a place where you can grow, learn 
          and connect with other like minded people. A place where you can come and be revitalised and re-energised 
          to go out and take on the "real" world. There are plenty of workshops for the young and old in the 
          healing village as well as massage and reiki.
          Over the weekend the music will range through many genres.On the Friday night it will be a funk, glitch 
          and drum and bass session then saturday night your more traditional techno, progressive and psytrance, with 
          diversity over the weekend being the main flavour.
          There are a few things we at Mushroom Valley Productions are extremely passionate about. One thing is providing 
          a safe and respectful environment for the whole family from young to old.

          We want to provide an experience that enriches your soul at the same time as giving you a place to party and socialize.
          Rabbits Eat Lettuce is a place of Freedom, Love & Dance Music. Camp in a beautiful natural environment and form a 
          community of like-minded souls who want to escape the hustle and bustle of the city life. Rabbits Eat Lettuce lets us 
          be human again. We can dissolve the social barriers and dance together.
          Rabbits Eat Lettuce began in 2008 as a Tribal Easter party on the mid-north-coast of NSW and has become an underground 
          tradition in the area, long lost brothers and sisters reconnect to dance, share stories, socialize and camp out under 
          the stars. The event has grown a lot since it’s humble beginnings as a forest dance party but still holds the same 
          essence of freedom and unique mystery it started with.

          Earth Frequency Festival is a music, arts, lifestyle and environmental festival based in South-East Queensland, Australia, 
          with a strong focus on arts, education, healing and community spirit. While drawing from many cultural niches such as transformational 
          festival, tribal gathering, doof and boutique festival, the aim of Earth Frequency Festival is to go beyond these traditional tags 
          and to exist as a multi-faceted gathering focused broadly on creativity, connection, intention and inspiration.
          From its origins as a small landcare party in 2005, Earth Frequency has now become one of Australia's foremost transformational 
          gatherings. At Earth Frequency, you can always expect an amazing mixture of live and electronic music, performance, visionary art, 
          workshops and lectures, a family and kids space, a fantastic food and markets area, and of course a positive community vibe.  
          Our aim is to create nothing short of a life changing, transformative experience! We aim to provide a meeting place - people from 
          many different backgrounds, ages and walks of life come together with the shared interests of music, nature, technology, culture and peace. 
          Earth Frequency Festival is held each year at Ivory's Rock Conventions and Events in Peak Crossing. Ivory's Rock is a beautiful outdoor 
          venue with top notch facilities, comfortable campgrounds, and it is conveniently located under an hour from Brisbane and just 20 minutes 
          from Ipswich. Nurtured by the setting of the beautiful Australian outdoors, we gather together once a year to celebrate life with music, 
          art and other creative forms, and to educate, connect, heal and inspire.  For those attending, it may just be the defining weekend of your summer!
